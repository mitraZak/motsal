Motsal is a data analysis tool focused on saccadic eye movements, captured using an eye-tracker during various psychophysics-based visual tasks.

Built with Python, Motsal leverages libraries for statistical analysis, signal processing, and basic machine learning (e.g., regression). It can automatically classify eye movement data according to task-specific conditions, enabling insights into visual attention and cognitive processes.
